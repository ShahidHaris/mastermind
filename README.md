## Game Overview

Mastermind is a classic board game where one player sets a secret code, and the other player (or the computer) tries to guess it within a limited number of turns. The game can be played in two modes: Code Breaker and Code Maker.

- **Code Breaker**: In this mode, you will try to guess the computer-generated secret code within 12 turns.

- **Code Maker**: In this mode, you set the secret code, and the computer tries to guess it within 12 turns.

## Installation

To play the Mastermind game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShahidHaris/mastermind.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mastermind
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   ruby mastermind.rb
   ```

## How to Play

When you run the game, you will be prompted to choose your role:

- Enter `B` to play as the Code Breaker.
- Enter `M` to play as the Code Maker.

### Code Breaker Mode

If you choose to be the Code Breaker (`B`), you will try to guess the computer's secret code. Follow these steps:

1. Enter your guesses for the secret code, selecting four colors from `r`, `g`, `o`, `y`, `v`, and `m`.

2. You can keep guessing until you either:
   - Correctly guess the code (all colors and positions match), in which case you win.
   - Reach the maximum number of turns (12) without guessing the code, in which case you lose.

### Code Maker Mode

If you choose to be the Code Maker (`M`), you will set the secret code, and the computer will try to guess it. Follow these steps:

1. Set your secret code by entering four colors from `r`, `g`, `o`, `y`, `v`, and `m`.

2. The computer will attempt to guess your code in each turn.

3. You can watch as the computer tries to guess your code.

4. You win if the computer correctly guesses your code (all colors and positions match) within 12 turns.

5. You lose if the computer cannot guess your code within 12 turns.

## Game Logic

The Mastermind game logic is implemented as follows:

- The secret code is a combination of four colors chosen from the available options: `r`, `g`, `o`, `y`, `v`, and `m`.

- The computer generates a secret code for the Code Maker or attempts to guess the code for the Code Breaker.

- Players can make guesses by selecting four colors from the available options.

- Feedback is provided for each guess:
  - The number of exact matches (correct color and position).
  - The number of color matches (correct color but wrong position).

- The game continues until one of the players (or the computer) wins or the maximum number of turns (12) is reached.

- Code Maker Mode: The computer uses a simple algorithm to guess the code based on the feedback received from previous guesses.

## Documentation

### Class: MastermindGame

#### Constants
- `BALLS`: An array containing six color codes (`r`, `g`, `o`, `y`, `v`, `m`) representing the possible colors for the code pegs. It is a constant array and cannot be modified.

#### Instance Variables
- `@combinations`: An array that stores all possible combinations of the code pegs. It is initialized with all the possible combinations at the start of the game.
- `@computer_code`: An array that stores the secret code generated by the computer (or set by the player in Code Maker mode).
- `@player_code`: An array that stores the code guessed by the player (or generated by the computer in Code Maker mode).
- `@counter`: An integer representing the current turn number.
- `@player_role`: A string (`'b'` or `'m'`) representing the role of the player (Code Breaker or Code Maker).

#### Methods

##### `initialize`
- Initializes the MastermindGame class.
- Sets up the instance variables.

##### `select_player_role`
- Prompts the player to choose their role as Code Breaker (B) or Code Maker (M).
- Validates the input until the player enters `'B'` or `'M'`.

##### `generate_code`
- Generates a random secret code by selecting four code pegs from the `BALLS` array.

##### `player_selection`
- Allows the player to enter a guess for the code by selecting four colors from the available color options.

##### `possible_combinations`
- Generates and returns an array of all possible combinations of code pegs using the `BALLS` array.

##### `computer_selection`
- Returns a random combination from the `@combinations` array as the computer's guess.

##### `compare_arrays(computer, player)`
- Compares the computer's guess (or the player's guess) with the secret code.
- Counts the number of exact matches (correct color and position) and color matches (correct color but wrong position).

##### `play`
- Main entry point for starting the game.
- Calls either `play_as_code_breaker` or `play_as_code_maker` based on the player's role.

##### `play_as_code_breaker`
- Implements the logic for the Code Breaker role.

##### `play_as_code_maker`
- Implements the logic for the Code Maker role.

##### `play_cases(match)`
- A helper method used in the Code Maker role to filter the possible combinations based on the feedback received from the computer's guesses.
